======================

Just a simple finance planner thing.  I've been using an idiotically complicated Excel spreadsheet for
this purpose for years, and over the years have often seen people hitting the same problems that I made
the initial spreadsheet to solve.

Only I really can't be bothered going through how to set that spreadsheet up with other people.

So thought I'd use this as a chance to mess around with Ember, PouchDB, and all in all try and make a
more reproducable version of that spreadsheet but in a format that can be used by anyone.

In an ideal world the server will just need to feed up some JS as I really don't want to be storing
financial data anywhere server-side.
